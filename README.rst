Warning
-------

This API is probably not ready for use for your gamepad.
Here are the stuff I need to do to make it work with my gamepad :

* Find the gamepad name and add it to the list `device_name_keywords` in gamepad.py
* Depending on your usage you may want to update `common_names` which is a mapping of the button/axis


An asynchronous (threaded) API for interfacing with gamepads.
